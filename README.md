# ObjectUtils
Java library to implement functions which are already available in other languages but not in java!!

  1. dataTypeOf() -> to find the datatype of the input or already initialized variable
  2. getObjectSizeOf() -> to find the size of every data-type
  3. isInstanceOf() -> tells whether the declared or pre existing variable belongs to the defined class or not
  4. apply() -> works as a lambda function for the language (building a functionality in one line)
  5. toUnsignedInt() -> converts the integer type data type value to unsigned Integer
